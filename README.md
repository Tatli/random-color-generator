# random-color-generator

An application that will return a random color in the command line.

# Description

When a user enters node index.js in the command line, a block of approximately 31x9 `#` characters colored with a random color (using hex code, e.g. #ff0000) should be generated.

Users should be able to provide **hue** (e.g. _green or red or blue_) and **luminosity** (e.g. _light or dark_) values, for the application to then generate random colors that match those choices.
